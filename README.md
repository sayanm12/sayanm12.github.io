# Welcome!
I am a third year graduate student working under the supervision of [**Dr. Souvik Roy**](https://souvikroy.weebly.com/) in the [**_Economic Research Unit_**](https://www.isical.ac.in/units/economic-research-unit) at the [**_Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata_**](https://www.isical.ac.in/). Prior to this, I completed my Masters in Statistics (M.Stat) from the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. 

# Research Interests
- Dynamic models of evolution and learning in games.
- Bayesian evolution in games.
- 

My primary research interests include dynamic models of deterministic and stochastic evolution and learning in complete/incomplete information games.
# Research
- "_**Generalized perturbed best response dynamics with a continuum of strategies**_" with Ratul Lahkar and Souvik Roy (forthcoming in **Journal of Economic Theory, 2021**).
- "_**Regularized Bayesian best response learning in finite games**_" with Souvik Roy (submitted).
- "_**Perturbed Bayesian best response dynamics under continuum logit choice**_" with Souvik Roy (in preparation).
- "_**Medium-run convergence in continuum supermodular games**_" with Ratul Lahkar and Souvik Roy (in preparation).
- "_**Stochastic Evolution under smooth perturbations in continuum games**_" with Ratul Lahkar and Souvik Roy (working paper)
- "_**Externalities in aggregative games**_"
- "_**Graphon valued stochastic evolution in games**_" with Soumendu Sundar Mukherjee and Souvik Roy.
