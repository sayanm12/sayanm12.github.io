# Welcome!
I am a third year PhD student working under the supervision of **Dr. Souvik Roy** in the **_Economic Research Unit_** at the **_Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata_**. Prior to this, I completed my Masters in Statistics (M.Stat) from the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. 

My primary research interests include evolution and learning in games. I am also interested in various stochastic models arising in games.
# Research

- "_**Perturbed Bayesian best response dynamics under continuum logit choice**_" with Souvik Roy (in preparation).
- "_**Medium-run convergence in continuum supermodular games**_" with Ratul Lahkar and Souvik Roy (in preparation).
- "_**Stochastic Evolution under smooth perturbations in continuum games**_" with Ratul Lahkar and Souvik Roy (working paper)
