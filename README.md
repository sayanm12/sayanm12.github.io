# Welcome!
I am a third year PhD student working under the supervision of Dr. Souvik Roy in the Economic Research Unit at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. Prior to this, I completed my Masters in Statistics (M.Stat) from the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata.

My primary research interests include evolution and learning in games. I am also interested in various stochastic models arising in games.
